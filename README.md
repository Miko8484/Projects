# Projects
Here I listed some projects that I worked on. I made them in high school and at university, so please take notice that some of the code was done with little experience and with basic knowledge. I would also like to point out that they were done in scope of some tasks, so variable names might not be named "correctly" and there is little commenting. I do realize that when working on big projects and especially in group variable names need to be logical, explanatory and comments need to be included. Now when I have more knowledge I also see that it might be better to divide code in more functions. Name of variables are "correctly" used in bigger and later projects. Below there is short description for each project and they are ordered in chronicle order.

SPTS_PROJECT (Web - HTML,CSS,PHP)
This was my first big project. It's a website made in MVC architectural pattern without any framework. It was done in high school and website allows users to register and login. Users then can create tournaments, add teams, print out matches and fill out score for each match. At the end they get table with final standings.

CashierApp (Desktop - C#)
It was my second project in high school. It was done for informative days. I worked with professors and it can use scanner that is connected with USB to the computer and we basically have a cashier. App allows us to add, delete, change products. We can also scan products, input users payment and print out the receipt.

WebMobile project (Web - Angular, Mobile - Ionic)
This project was done in a group. We created a website(Angular) and mobile(Ionic) application. We made a game, which is mixture of chess and GO. On website we created basic pages for registration/login, page to play the game etc. We also used algorithm MIN-MAX for the game itself. For mobile app we used Ionic, where we included different plugins so we could use camera, Google Maps etc. We stored user information in a database and used SQL to run queries.

Minesweeper (Desktop - C#)
Here I created well known game Minesweeper, but a bit different. One user can set up a server and decide how many players can join. Other players join servers IP and game start when all players are joined in. So it is basically a multiplayer Minesweeper where users compete between them self with points. Communication was done with sockets.

Bachelor Project (Web - Vue.js, Laravel)
It's my latest project for Bachelor degree. Here I am using Vue.js and Laravel to create a website where users can play sport bets for free. There are matches that I get from different API and store them in database. Later I get them at backend and send them to front end with help of API. It's still in development.
